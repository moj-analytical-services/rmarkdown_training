```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(readr)

crimes <- read_csv("crimedata.csv")
```

# Trend over time
Over time, crime has changed.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 3}
plot(crimes)
```

# Key figures
```{r include=FALSE}
maxcrimes <- max(crimes$crimes)
library(dplyr)
latestcrimes <- last(crimes$crimes)
```

The maximum number of crimes was `r maxcrimes`. The latest number was `r latestcrimes`.
