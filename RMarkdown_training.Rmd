crimedata <- read_csv("crimedata.csv")
```

# Trend over time
Over time, the number of crimes has changed.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6}
ggplot(crimedata, aes(year, crimes)) + geom_line() +
  expand_limits(y=c(0,200))
```

# Key figures
```{r echo = FALSE}
maxcrimes <- max(crimedata$crimes)
mincrimes <- min(crimedata$crimes)
```

The minimum number of crimes was `r mincrimes` and the maximum was `r maxcrimes`.

```{r echo = FALSE}
crimedata <- arrange(crimedata, year)

latestyear <- last(crimedata$year)
latestcrimes <- last(crimedata$crimes)
```

In the latest year (`r latestyear`) there were `r latestcrimes` crimes.
